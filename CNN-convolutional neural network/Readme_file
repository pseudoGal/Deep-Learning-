Oxfords Visual Geometry Group, or VGG for short

The VGG() class takes a few arguments that may only interest you if you are looking to use
the model in your own project, e.g. for transfer learning. For example:
 include top (True): Whether or not to include the output layers for the model. You
don’t need these if you are fitting the model on your own problem.
 weights (‘imagenet’): What weights to load. You can specify None to not load pre-
trained weights if you are interested in training the model yourself from scratch.
 input tensor (None): A new input layer if you intend to fit the model on new data of a
different size.
 input shape (None): The size of images that the model is expected to take if you change
the input layer.
 pooling (None): The type of pooling to use when you are training a new set of output
layers.
 classes (1000): The number of classes (e.g. size of output vector) for the model.
Next, let’s look at using the loaded VGG model to classify ad hoc photographs.
